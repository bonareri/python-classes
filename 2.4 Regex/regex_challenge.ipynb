    "1. Write a Python program to check that a string contains only a certain set of characters (in this case a-z, A-Z and 0-9).\n",
    "2. Write a Python program that matches a string that has an ‘a’ followed by anything, ending in ‘b’.\n",
    "3. Write a program that uses regex to validate user input. Examples:\n",
    "    - Check if a password meets certain criteria (e.g., minimum length, containing uppercase and lowercase letters).\n",
    "    - Validate a date format (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY).\n",
    "4. Write a program that uses regex to extract specific information from a string.        Examples:\n",
    "    - Extract email addresses: Find all strings containing “@” and a dot (.).\n",
    "    - Extract phone numbers: Find all strings with a specific format (e.g., XXX-XXX-XXXX).\n",
    "5. Write a program that uses regex to search for and replace text in a string. \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    - Replace all occurrences of “Mr.” with “Ms.”: text.replace(r”Mr.”, “Ms.”) (r prefix for raw string)"
