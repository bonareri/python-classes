    "## What is a Web Service?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **web service** is a way for two computers or apps to talk to each other over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps one program send or receive information from another, just like how a phone call connects two people. For example, a weather app uses a web service to get weather updates from a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "`In simple terms:`\n",
    "A web service lets one application request data or functionality from another application, even if they are built using different programming languages or run on different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web services use standard communication protocols like `HTTP` and data formats like `XML` or `JSON` to exchange data between systems built using different programming languages or platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of Web Services\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Different applications from various sources can work together seamlessly.\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: Can be used to build both simple and complex services.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easily deployed across different networks and environments.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Allows reuse of services in multiple applications.\n",
    "- **Standardized Communication**: Uses common protocols like HTTP, XML, JSON, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of Web Services\n",
    "- **Service Provider**: The system offering the service.\n",
    "- **Service Requestor**: The system or application consuming the service.\n",
    "- **Service Registry**: A directory where available services are listed and discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Web Services Work (Simple Flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A client sends a request (e.g., `Give me user details`)\n",
    "2. The web service processes the request\n",
    "3. The service sends back a response (usually data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Web Services\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **REST (Representational State Transfer) (Most Common)**\n",
    "- **Architectural style** using HTTP methods (`GET, POST, PUT, DELETE`).\n",
    "- Uses **URLs** to access resources.\n",
    "- Data format: `JSON` (mostly) or `XML`\n",
    "- Lightweight, stateless, and widely used in mobile/web apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A weather API returning today’s temperature in `JSON`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**\n",
    "- Use `XML` only\n",
    "- Operates over protocols like **HTTP** and **SMTP**.\n",
    "- Reliable, secure, but more complex and slower.\n",
    "- Strict Security (WS-Security).\n",
    "- ACID compliance (ensures transactions are fully completed or fully failed, never half-done).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Banking or enterprise systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Examples\n",
    "- Online Banking: Secure customer access to accounts and transactions via web applications.\n",
    "- Weather Apps: Use APIs to retrieve real-time weather data.\n",
    "- E-commerce: Services like Amazon expose product search, reviews, and payments as APIs.\n",
    "- Mobile Apps: Apps communicate with remote servers using RESTful web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mobile app fetching data from a backend server\n",
    "- Payment gateways (e.g., M-Pesa, PayPal APIs)\n",
    "- Google Maps API showing maps in websites\n",
    "- Social media logins (Sign in with Google/Facebook)"

    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- Elements: The basic building blocks of an XML document.\n",
    "    - It holds the actual data and gives it meaning using descriptive tags.\n",

    "- Attributes: Provide extra information about elements.\n",
    "    - Example: ```<price currency=\"USD\">19.99</price>```\n",
    "- XML Declaration: Optional first line in XML.\n",
    "    - Example: ```<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>```\n",
    "- Well-formed XML: Must follow rules like:\n",
    "    - A single root element.\n",
    "    - Proper nesting and closing of tags.\n",
    "    - Attributes in quotes.\n",
    "- Comments:\n",

    "### What is JSON?\n",
    "JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**. It is a **lightweight data-interchange format** that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications between a server and a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### History and Development\n",
    "JSON was originally derived from JavaScript, but it is language-independent and supported by many programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of JSON\n",
    "JSON is built on two structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A collection of name/value pairs: Often referred to as an object, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array in various programming languages.\n",
    "- An ordered list of values: Often referred to as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON Syntax Rules\n",
    "- Data is in **name/value pairs**: `{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30 }`\n",
    "- Data is **comma-separated** ```{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\" }```\n",
    "- Objects are wrapped in **curly braces `{ \"employee\": { \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\" } }`**\n",
    "- Arrays are wrapped in **square brackets `{ \"employees\": [\"John\", \"Anna\", \"Peter\"] }`**\n",
    "- Keys (names) must be **strings** enclosed in double quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON Data Types\n",
    "- String: Text data, enclosed in double quotes.\n",
    "- Number: Numeric data, without quotes.\n",
    "- Object: A collection of key/value pairs, enclosed in curly braces.\n",
    "- Array: An ordered list of values, enclosed in square brackets.\n",
    "- Boolean: True or false values.\n",
    "- Null: Represents an empty or null value\n",
