    "1. Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number in a limited number of attempts. Provide feedback after each guess (higher, lower, or correct).\n",
    "2. Write a program that allows the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and perform the corresponding calculation. Use conditional statements to handle different operators\n",
    "3. Write a program that uses a while loop to check if a number entered by the user is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and itself).\n",
    "4. Write a program that uses a for loop to print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user (up to a specified number of multiples).\n",
    "5. Write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number entered by the user.\n",
    "6. Write a program that uses a for loop to print a pattern of stars or characters like a triangle."
