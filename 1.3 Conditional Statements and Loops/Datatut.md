# What is Data Storytelling?

Data storytelling is the process of transforming raw data into a clear and meaningful narrative that helps people understand what is happening, why it is happening, and what actions should be taken.

It combines three key elements:
- Data – the raw facts and numbers
- Analysis – identifying patterns, trends, and insights
- Storytelling – communicating insights in a way that is easy to understand and act on

Instead of presenting numbers alone, data storytelling focuses on context, insights, and impact.

# Why Do We Need Excel and Power BI for Data Storytelling?

Different tools play different roles in the data storytelling process. Excel and Power BI complement each other by supporting different stages of the data journey, from data preparation to insight communication.

# Role of Excel in Data Storytelling

Excel is primarily used for data exploration and preparation.

Excel helps to:
- Explore and understand the structure of the data
- Clean data by handling:
  - Missing values
  - Duplicates
  - Inconsistent formatting
- Perform quick calculations and validations
- Conduct initial analysis using formulas and pivot tables

Excel answers the question:

> Is the data clean, understandable, and ready for analysis?

Because it is flexible and easy to use, Excel is ideal for early-stage analysis and validation.

# Role of Power BI in Data Storytelling

Power BI is used to visualize insights and communicate the data story.

Power BI enables us to:
- Create interactive dashboards and reports
- Visualize trends, patterns, and comparisons
- Highlight key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Allow users to explore data using filters and slicers
- Present insights to non-technical stakeholders clearly

Power BI answers the question:

> What does the data mean, and what decisions should be made?

This is where insights are transformed into actionable stories.

# How Excel and Power BI Work Together

| Tool     | Role in the Data Story |
|----------|------------------------|
| Excel    | Data exploration, cleaning, and preparation |
| Power BI | Visualization, storytelling, and decision support |

Together, Excel and Power BI ensure that:
- Data is accurate and reliable
- Insights are clearly communicated
- Decision-makers can easily interpret and act on the findings

# Summary

Data storytelling is about turning data into insight and insight into action. Excel helps prepare and understand the data, while Power BI brings the story to life through visuals and interactive dashboards.
